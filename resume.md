### Experience

**Asurion** *Senior Principal Software Engineer* __2007 to present__
	Over a 13 year career at Asurion I have worked on a number of high-impact projects in support of our core mission to be the world's largest provider of technology support and protection services. 

__**Notable Projects**__

***Solution Hub*** __2012-13__
	In support of our retail Extended Service Contract business, I was the technical lead for building a new web platform allowing our customers to manage their plans and claims in one centralized application. I was the principal architect of both the application platform and DevOps processes, implemening one of the first true Continuous Devlivery pipelines in the Asurion technology organization. 
	**Technical Environment** Scala, Play Framework, jQuery, Robot Framework, Solr

***Horizon Web*** __2014-2019__
	Applying the best practices and technology developed for the Solution Hub platform, I was the lead developer and principal architect for the customer-facing web application for the Horizon Platform, a green-field implementation to support Asurion's Mobile Protection line of business.
	This project was on the vanguard of Asurion's move to the cloud and I was a key player in designing and implementing a new cloud architecture and DevOps pipeline for managing a highly-parallel development process.
	In addition to the implementation of core application features, I drove the implementation and adoption of a robust and highly effective feature testing framework that allowed us to rapidly roll out new features in a phased, monitored deployment. 
	**Technical Environment** Scala, Play Framework, ReactJS, Redux, Docker, AWS

***Project Castalia*** __2018-2019__
	As the operational complexity of our systems grew, I took the initiative to develop an operational monitoring platform that gave reliable, realtime insight into our system's operational status. 
	By ingesting, aggregating and reconciling multiple heterogenous streams of realtime data we were able to produce an up-to-the-minute view of the health of our system. 
	Ultimately, we were able to build continuously updating machine learning models to detect system anomalies affecting real users in close to real time, allowing us to respond quickly to system impairments while minimizing the prevalance of time-wasting false postives.
	**Technical Environment** Scala, Spark Streaming, Elasticsearch

***Security Mavens*** __2017-Present__
	I have been a senior member of Asurion's Security Mavens program, the intent of which is to instill deep knowledge of application and information security in engineers outside of the traditional security organization. As part of the program, I have obtained multiple industry-recognized certifications in pentration testing, secure development practives, secure DevOps practices and exploit development. 
	More importantly, I have take the knowledged obtained through my training and certifications and used it to move security "left in the pipeline," building out a robust DevSecOps pipeline for the Horizon platform.
